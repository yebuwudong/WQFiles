//  Minimal ZIP writer and reader (stored and deflate, via zlib). Files are
//  read through a small I/O table, so the same code works on other apps'
//  containers (through WQAccess) and on plain files in host tests.
//
//  Writing: ZIP files up to 4 GB with at most 65535 entries. Reading also
//  understands ZIP64. Extraction never creates symbolic links, refuses entry
//  names that would leave the target folder, checks every entry's size and
//  CRC, and writes only into the (local, empty) folder it is given.
