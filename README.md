# Worse Query Files

**WQ Files** is a file browser, app data manager and cache cleaner for iOS 26
and 27. "WQ" stands for worse_query, the sandbox technique it is built on. It
reaches other apps' and system containers with no jailbreak and no kernel
exploit. Tested on iOS 26.7.1, 27.0.1 and 27.2.

**iOS 26 (26.0 to 26.7.2):** preliminary support since 0.7; tested on 26.7.1. worse_query reaches the app, extension, daemon and app group
containers there, but not System Data or the system groups, so WQ Files hides
those two and the Cache Cleaner has no crash-log section. A full inode scan
would take most of an hour on iOS 26, so App Data, Extension Data and App
Groups are listed from the LaunchServices database instead (found once and
remembered). Internal Daemons aren't in that database: the first scan for them
takes long, later ones only check new files. Apps, backups, restores, clearing
app data, the Cache Cleaner and the file browser work as on iOS 27. App icons
don't: iOS 26 hands WQ Files only placeholder icons and doesn't let it read
other apps' bundles, so apps show symbol tiles.

WQ Files is available in English, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Arabic
and Simplified Chinese. It follows the device language; **Language** in WQ Files'
Settings picks another, used from the next start.

## What it opens

- **App Data**: every app's data container (`Containers/Data/Application`),
  shown with the app's name, bundle ID and icon instead of a UUID.
- **App Groups**: shared group containers.
- **Extension Data** and **Internal Daemons**.
- **App Bundles**: each installed app's bundle container
  (`/var/containers/Bundle/Application`) with its `.app`, labeled with the
  app's name; also from Apps: long-press an app → **Open App Bundle**. Shown
  only where iOS lets WQ Files open these folders (the startup check tries;
  iOS 26 and 27.0.1 don't).
- **System Data**: `/var/containers/Data/System` (listing only; its contents
  are owned by root).
- **System Groups**: the parent cannot be listed on 27.0.1, so known container
  names are tried one by one; tap **+** to try another name. Covers the
  MobileGestalt cache and the configuration-profiles (Supervision) folder.
- **Go to Path** for any absolute path.

The container parents can't be listed, so App Data, Extension Data and App
Groups come from the LaunchServices database, which lists every installed
app's and extension's containers. It is found once (among the newest files,
usually within seconds) and remembered. Internal Daemons, and the app folders
when the database can't be read, need a scan of every file id (`fsgetpath`,
the way KAMUI does it): minutes on a well-used device the first time, so WQ
Files asks before it starts and shows a scan window; later scans only check
new files.

## Tools

- **Apps**: every app with its data size. Back up an app's **Documents and
  Library**, restore the latest backup (also from **App Backups**: long-press the app → Restore Backup), clear its data (Documents, Library,
  and tmp), open its folder, or share a backup as a ZIP over AirDrop, Files,
  Mail and so on. **Import as Backup…** (tap an app) turns a folder or ZIP with
  `Documents`/`Library` (another device's shared backup, another tool's export)
  into a normal verified backup of that app, ready to restore; data that says
  it belongs to a different app asks first. Show all apps, only Apple's, only others, only backed-up
  ones, or only installed or offloaded ones (when nearly every app's state can be read); long-press to copy the bundle ID or container path.
  Apps and the Cache Cleaner keep their list between visits and rescan on
  their own after 10 minutes; pull down to rescan any time. `tmp` is intentionally ephemeral: clear removes it, but app
  backups do not include it and restore leaves the current `tmp` untouched.
- **Cache Cleaner**: cache and temp size per app, with search, Select All /
  None / Large Caches (50 MB+) and crash logs. Long-press an app to jump to its
  Caches, tmp or data folder.
- **Files**: browse, read and share files; each opens in the fitting tool,
  and **Open As** switches between them. Saving writes back in place (same
  inode, owner and attributes). Create folders, import files (several at
  once) or whole folders with everything inside, rename and
  delete (long-press, or swipe a row to the left; deleting always asks
  first). Sort by name, date modified, date created or size from the •••
  menu; long lists sorted by name get an A–Z sidebar. Long-press a folder to share it as a ZIP.
  - **Select** (top right) several items to move, compress or delete them
    together. **Move** works across apps: pick the items, open the target
    folder in any app's data, tap **Move Here**. Existing items are never
    replaced.
  - **Compress** creates a ZIP next to the items; **Extract** (long-press a
    .zip) unpacks it into a new folder. Entries that would land outside that
    folder, encrypted ZIPs and symbolic links are refused or left out.
  - **Plist editor**: browse dictionaries and arrays, edit values by type
    (switches for booleans, numbers, text, dates, data as hex), add, delete,
    rename and reorder. Saves in the file's own format (binary or XML).
  - **Hex viewer and editor**: any file size (read in pages), go to offset,
    find hex bytes or text, overwrite bytes in place. Changed bytes are
    highlighted until saved; the file size never changes.
  - **SQLite viewer and editor**: tables and views with row counts, rows,
    single rows in full, SQL queries and CSV export. It works on a copy of the
    database and its `-wal` file; close the app first for an up-to-date copy.
    **Edit** changes that copy: tap a value in a row to change it, swipe a row
    to delete it, or run any SQL. **Save** writes the copy back to the app:
    force-quit the app first (WQ Files can't tell whether it's running). Before
    writing, WQ Files checks the copy with SQLite's integrity check and refuses
    if the app changed the database since it was opened; the previous
    database goes to Backups, and the app's old `-wal`/`-shm` are emptied so
    SQLite doesn't replay them over the new file.
  - **Media player**: audio and video (mp3, m4a, wav, mp4, mov…) play in the
    system player. WQ Files streams the file to the player itself, so playback
    starts right away; formats that can't stream this way (or a stream that
    fails) are copied to WQ Files' temporary folder first.
  - **Text and images**: text is editable, images render, plists can also be
    edited as XML text. Code and data files get syntax colors (XML/plist,
    JSON, YAML, INI/TOML, CSS, SQL, Markdown, C/Objective-C, Swift,
    JavaScript/TypeScript, Java/Kotlin, Go, Rust, Python, shell, Ruby, Lua;
    up to 1 MB).
- **Log**: file writes, backups, deletions, restores and errors the app handled, plus the App Group it received.
- **Allow Deleting** (start screen, on by default): turn it off and nothing
  can be deleted, cleared or cleaned; saving, moving and restoring still work.
- **Show Item Counts** (start screen, off by default): folders show how many
  items they hold. Every subfolder is listed for this, which slows down
  folders with many subfolders.
- **Keep Data Before Restore** (start screen, on by default): restoring an app
  backup or a file backup first backs up what's there now, so a failed restore
  can be undone. Turn it off to delete that backup once the restore succeeded.

App names come from LaunchServices' own database, read from lsd's container
(the LaunchServices API itself refuses this app on 27.x). Apple services that
only have localized names use a built-in table. Services without an icon get a
symbol tile.

## Safety

Before a regular file is overwritten or deleted, its contents are copied to
**Backups** inside the app (also reachable in the Files app). Long-press a
backup to restore it to its original location. **Recently Deleted** (under
Backups on the start screen) lists the backed-up files whose original is gone,
newest first: restore one to where it was (missing folders are created), or
delete it from Backups for good. In the file browser only empty
folders can be deleted; symbolic links are removed as links. Clearing an app's
data and cleaning caches delete without a file-by-file backup; Apps offers to
back up Documents and Library first, while `tmp` is discarded and cannot be
restored. Close the target app before backup, restore, or clear. App copies are
verified by a source-stability digest, a destination-shape digest and stored
part content hashes (rechecked before restore and rollback), and purge
postconditions are rechecked, but the operations are not filesystem snapshots
if the target app keeps running. Target data is changed only in response to
explicit actions; interrupted safety transactions may be recovered on startup.

File saves retain the original inode and verify descriptor identity and saved
contents. Locks are advisory: another app that ignores them can still write
concurrently, and in-place writes are not crash-atomic. Close the target app and
keep the durable backups. Recovery fails closed when required safety material is
missing. Generic overwrite/delete operations on backup-storage files are refused
to avoid recursively backing up backups; valid backups can still be restored.
App backups live in **App Backups** (also in the Files app); old ones are never
pruned automatically. Tap **Select** in **Backups** or **App Backups** to
choose one or more complete backup folders and delete them together; a single
folder can still be removed with **Delete Backup**. Automatic pruning is
intentionally left out so a safety copy is never discarded without a user
decision.

Editing another app's or the system's files can break things. Keep the backups
and only change what you understand.

## Troubleshooting

- **Startup check**: while the start screen is up, WQ Files checks in the
  background the App Group, whether it finds other apps' folders, whether its
  sandbox access really opens a sample of them, and whether the app database
  identifies them. A new iOS version can break any of these; instead of empty
  or wrong lists, WQ Files then covers everything with what failed (Try Again,
  Log, Continue Anyway). Problems that
  leave it partly usable (app names, an untested iOS version) are shown once as
  a warning. The result is in **Log** as `health: …`.

- **Apps list is empty**: the Apps screen depends on a full `fsgetpath` scan of
  the data volume. A missing/denied container parent, an unavailable inode
  probe, or an exhausted scan bound is logged as `enumerate: …` and
  `app scan: …` in **Log**. The current build only treats a *missing* parent as
  failure; a denied parent and a completion-probe miss still return the
  scanned subset, so refresh instead of assuming there are no apps.
- **`NO TOKEN`**: the container path was visible but `wq_grant` could not
  obtain a sandbox token. Common causes are a signer that dropped the App
  Group, an app-group cache-swap failure, or a container the app-group query
  refuses. See the `grant failed`/`enumerate` lines in **Log**.
- **`(no label)`**: a token was obtained, but the container identifier
  (`com.apple.containermanager.identifier` xattr or the container metadata
  plist) could not be read. On iOS 27.2 the attribute can't be read at all,
  so WQ Files also asks the container manager for a path-to-identifier map
  and then looks the container up in the LaunchServices database, which lists
  the data container of every app and most extensions. If the identifier is
  still missing (for example a system/daemon container with none, or an
  extension the database doesn't list), the folder stays browsable but cannot
  be backed up or cleared until identity is available.

```

Or download `WQFiles.ipa` from [Releases](https://github.com/kolbicz/WQFiles/releases) and sign it yourself.

## Signing: the App Group

WQ Files needs an **App Group** to work: worse_query asks for access through
your app's group container. Whatever signs the IPA must give it one. The app
uses whichever group it receives, so the group name doesn't matter. The top
of **Log** shows the group it got, or "No App Group" when it got none.

- **AltStore, SideStore or [Impactor](https://github.com/claration/impactor)
  with your Apple ID** (free or paid): they create the App Group
  automatically. This is the easiest way. Impactor runs on macOS, Windows and
  Linux; it's confirmed to work with a paid developer account. **Sideloadly
  doesn't add the App Group**, so WQ Files signed with it reports "No App
  Group".
- **Feather, ESign and similar tools with a certificate (.p12) and a
  provisioning profile:** the profile has to contain an App Group. Wildcard
  profiles (App ID `*`), which most certificate sellers provide, can't contain
  one, so signing fails with an entitlement error, or the app reports "No App
  Group".
- **Your own developer account:** in the Apple Developer portal create an App
  Group (Identifiers → App Groups), create an explicit App ID with the **App
  Groups** capability and that group assigned, then create a provisioning
  profile for that App ID. Sign the IPA with that profile, keeping the App
  Group entitlement.

## Build and signing

`./build.sh` compiles an arm64 binary and ad-hoc signs it with an App Group
entitlement (`group.cz.kolbi.wqfiles`). The technique needs an App Group, so
re-sign with a tool that keeps one; the app uses whichever group it actually
receives and shows it at the top of the **Log**. If it reports "No App Group",
the signer dropped it.

The deployment minimum is iOS 26.0. Builds first run the host regression suite,
then stage and validate the archive, metadata, signature and App Group before
replacing `WQFiles.ipa` in the project directory. Set `WQ_SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1` for
fixture builds that do not have a test tree. For a separate output, set
`WQFILES_FINAL_IPA` to an absolute path in an existing directory. The source
updater validates the IPA's embedded metadata before atomically replacing
`source.json`; its version/build arguments must match the artifact, and an
existing release description is preserved when no new notes are supplied.

## Regression tests

Run `./tests/run_all_tests.sh` on macOS with Xcode and Python 3. It runs twelve
portable Foundation fixture executables, the Python release fixtures, static
browser checks, and strict iOS arm64 compilation/linkage. Logs and generated
files stay under `.work/tests/`; the existing IPA is not replaced. With only
Command Line Tools installed, set `WQ_SKIP_IOS_CHECK=1` to run the host tests.
Set `WQ_ASAN=1` to compile the host fixtures with AddressSanitizer.

These tests use disposable files and entitlement/access doubles. They do not
issue sandbox tokens or mutate installed app containers. Real iOS signing,
token issuance, navigation/lifecycle timing, power-loss behavior and app-side
concurrent writes still require supported-device validation.

## Translations

WQ Files is in English, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Arabic and
Simplified Chinese. New languages and corrections are welcome as pull requests:

- **Correct a translation:** edit the line in `<language>.lproj/Localizable.strings`
  (for example `it.lproj`). The English text on the left is the key; change
  only the text on the right.
- **Add a language:** copy `en.lproj` to a folder named with the language code
  (`fr.lproj`, `pt-BR.lproj`…), translate the right-hand side, and add the code
  to `CFBundleLocalizations` in `Info.plist` and to `LANGUAGES` in
  `tests/test_localization.py`. The language then appears in WQ Files'
  Language setting by itself.
- Keep every placeholder (`%@`, `%lu`, `%.1f`…) in the same order as in the
  English text, and leave paths, file names and `WQ Files` as they are.
  `python3 -m unittest tests.test_localization` checks this.

German, Italian and Spanish, and the newest Chinese, Arabic and Korean strings, are
machine translations so far: corrections from native speakers are especially
welcome.
